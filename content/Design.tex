go through design considerations

\section{Architecture}
separate clusters for ingest, streaming, processing and ui

performance considerations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item large sliding window with short period requires lots of memory
	\item High allowed lateness increases time until records can be garbage collected
	\item Accumulation functions only need to store a single value instead of all like in process function
\end{itemize}

decoupling of ingestion and processing with persistent event log in between has benefits
\begin{itemize}
	\item handle backpressure without data loss
	\item decouple ingest and processing -> other processing possible
	\item replay in case of failure because not ephemeral
\end{itemize}

processing latency reasons:
reasons for latency: https://flink.apache.org/news/2019/02/25/monitoring-best-practices.html\#monitoring-latency
configuration can tradeoff latency vs throughput
not the same as stream latency caused by waiting for watermark
