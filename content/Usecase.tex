Looked for interesting use case which we can use to experiment with stream processing
Wanted to use real data

\section{HSL API Data}
Available data
statistics

\section{Analytics}
wanted to have analytics with challenges in different areas: pattern recognition, external queries

\subsection{Geoaggregation}
Division in cells
enables aggregation
provides way to reduce complexity with configurable resolution

late data handling
watermark bounded out of orderness time vs allowed lateness is a tradeoff between latency and recomputation effort
if only interested in latest window results: allowed lateness = window evaluation time
late side output if fine-grained handling required
but often if delayed: delayed much longer than allowed lateness, e.g. if bus is in tunnel instead of just small transmission delay
