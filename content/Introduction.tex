problem: Scalability + Stateful Processing (-> required for detection of complex events)

goal:
\begin{itemize}
    \item give an overview over correct, fault-tolerant, low-latency and scalable processing of streaming data
    \item demonstrate concepts through the design and implementation of an exemplary stream processing solution
\end{itemize}
