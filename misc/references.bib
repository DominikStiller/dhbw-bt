 abstract = {Complex Event Processing systems are a promising approach to detect patterns on ever growing amounts of event streams. Since a single server might not be able to run an operator at a sufficiently high rate, Data Parallel Complex Event Processing aims to distribute the load of one operator onto multiple nodes. In this work we analyze the splitter of an existing CEP framework, detail on its drawbacks and propose optimizations to cope with them. This yields the newly developed SPACE framework, which is evaluated and compared with an industry-proven CEP framework, Apache Flink. We show that the new splitter has greatly improved performance and is able to support more instances at a higher rate. In comparison with Apache Flink, the SPACE framework is able to process events at higher rates in our benchmarks but is less stable if overloaded.

Da ein einzelner Server nicht in der Lage sein kann, einen Operator mit einer ausreichenden Geschwindigkeit zu betreiben, versucht Data Parallel Complex Event Processing die Last eines Operators auf mehrere Knoten zu verteilen. In dieser Arbeit wird ein Splitter eines vorhandenen CEP systems analysiert, seine Nachteile hervorgearbeitet und Optimierungen vorgeschlagen. Daraus entsteht das neue SPACE Framework, welches evaluiert wird und mit Apache Flink, einem industrieerprobten CEP Framework, verglichen wird.

@article{Carbone.2015b,
 abstract = {Distributed stateful stream processing enables the deployment and execution of large scale continuous computations in the cloud, targeting both low latency and high throughput. One of the most fundamental challenges of this paradigm is providing processing guarantees under potential failures. Existing approaches rely on periodic global state snapshots that can be used for failure recovery. Those approaches suffer from two main drawbacks. First, they often stall the overall computation which impacts ingestion. Second, they eagerly persist all records in transit along with the operation states which results in larger snapshots than required. In this work we propose Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS), a lightweight algorithm suited for modern dataflow execution engines that minimises space requirements. ABS persists only operator states on acyclic execution topologies while keeping a minimal record log on cyclic dataflows. We implemented ABS on Apache Flink, a distributed analytics engine that supports stateful stream processing. Our evaluation shows that our algorithm does not have a heavy impact on the execution, maintaining linear scalability and performing well with frequent snapshots.},

@incollection{Cormode.2011b,
 abstract = {Sketch techniques have undergone extensive development within the past few

years. They are especially appropriate for the data streaming scenario, in

which large quantities of data flow by and the the sketch summary must

continually be updated quickly and compactly.  Sketches, as presented here,

are designed so that the update caused by each new piece of data is largely

independent of the current state of the summary.  This design choice makes

them faster to process, and also easy to parallelize.

``Frequency based sketches'' are concerned with summarizing the

observed frequency distribution of a dataset.  From these sketches,

accurate estimations of individual frequencies can be extracted.  This

leads to algorithms to find the approximate heavy hitters (items which

account for a large fraction of the frequency mass) and quantiles (the

median and its generalizations).  The same sketches are also used to

estimate (equi)join sizes between relations, self-join sizes and range

queries.  These can be used as primitives within more complex mining

operations, and to extract wavelet and histogram representations of

streaming data.

A different style of sketch construction leads to sketches for

distinct-value queries.  As mentioned above, using a sample to estimate the

answer to a COUNT DISTINCT query does not give accurate results.  In

contract, sketching methods which can make a pass over the whole data can

provide guaranteed accuracy.  Once built, these sketches estimate not only

the cardinality of a given attribute or combination of attributes, but also

the cardinality of various operations performed on them, such as set

operations (union and difference), and selections based on arbitrary

predicates.},

@article{Garcia.2020,
 abstract = {Water management is paramount in countries with water scarcity. This also affects agriculture, as a large amount of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global warming lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed at saving water usage in the irrigation process have increased over the years. Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation systems are very expensive, making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system. However, manufacturers are currently offering low-cost sensors that can be connected to nodes to implement affordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture monitoring. Due to the recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can be applied in the development of these systems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart irrigation systems. We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide an overview of the most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the best practices for the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.},

@article{GarciaAlvarez.2019,
 abstract = {Smart cities are urban environments where Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide a continuous source of data about urban phenomena such as traffic and air pollution. The exploitation of the spatial properties of data enables situation and context awareness. However, the integration and analysis of data from IoT sensing devices remain a crucial challenge for the development of IoT applications in smart cities. Existing approaches provide no or limited ability to perform spatial data analysis, even when spatial information plays a significant role in decision making across many disciplines. This work proposes a generic approach to enabling spatiotemporal capabilities in information services for smart cities. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach to achieving data integration and real-time processing, and developed a reference architecture for the development of event-driven applications. This type of applications seamlessly integrates IoT sensing devices, complex event processing, and spatiotemporal analytics through a processing workflow for the detection of geographic events. Through the implementation and testing of a system prototype, built upon an existing sensor network, we demonstrated the feasibility, performance, and scalability of event-driven applications to achieve real-time processing capabilities and detect geographic events.},

In this report, O'Reilly author Martin Kleppmann shows you how stream processing can make your data storage and processing systems more flexible and less complex. Structuring data as a stream of events isn't new, but with the advent of open source projects such as Apache Kafka and Apache Samza, stream processing is finally coming of age. Using several case studies, Kleppmann explains how these projects can help you reorient your database architecture around streams and materialized views. The benefits of this approach include better data quality, faster queries through precomputed caches, and real-time user interfaces. Learn how to open up your data for richer analysis and make your applications more scalable and robust in the face of failures. Understand stream processing fundamentals and their similarities to event sourcing, CQRS, and complex event processing Learn how logs can make search indexes and caches easier to maintain Explore the integration of databases with event streams, using the new Bottled Water open source tool Turn your database architecture inside out by orienting it around streams and materialized views.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the response time of a web service middleware that decomposes requests into sub-queries to different servers and then merges the results. We present a queuing model for such a fork-join system and an exact analysis for exponential server response times. We also provide accurate approximations for heavy-tailed server response times, which are a common effect in the Internet. Heavy-tailed distributions are critical since they may cause very long middleware response times, in particular in large-scale systems with many servers being involved. We show that in this case the performance can be significantly improved if the middleware does not have to wait for a few slow servers, i. e., if the merged result does not need to be absolutely complete. We discuss different choices to implement such a mechanism and quantify their impact on the middleware response time.},
