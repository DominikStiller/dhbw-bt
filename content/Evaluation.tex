\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Latency Tracking}
processing latency reasons:
reasons for latency: https://flink.apache.org/news/2019/02/25/monitoring-best-practices.html\#monitoring-latency
configuration can tradeoff latency vs throughput
not the same as stream latency caused by waiting for watermark


\subsection{Volume Scaling}
part of ingest
use recording and replay multiple times
each replay in separate process with two threads: s3 reader and kafka producer
payload adjustment


\section{Results}

describe cluster
calculate cluster costs per day

\subsection{Latency}
latency: latency is the delay between the creation of an event and the time at which results based on this event become visible (https://flink.apache.org/news/2019/02/25/monitoring-best-practices.html\#monitoring-latency)

maybe test very simple stateful job to see scalability without CEP and windowing
pass through to minimum latency possible
maybe have late data
use confidence interval

also show Kafka backlog

\subsection{Log Size}
measure log size with json vs binary protobuf


\section{Discussion}
