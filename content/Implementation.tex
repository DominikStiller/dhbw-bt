- sampling with regular events
- predict with dead reckoning to decrease event amount, 1d state space of trams is easily predictable

late data handling
watermark bounded out of orderness time vs allowed lateness is a tradeoff between latency and recomputation effort
if only interested in latest window results: allowed lateness = window evaluation time
late side output if fine-grained handling required
but often if delayed: delayed much longer than allowed lateness, e.g. if bus is in tunnel instead of just small transmission delay
