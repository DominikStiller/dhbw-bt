Batch data processing has become crucial and powers business-critical operations across industries. However, this style of processing is ill-suited for the continuous streams arising from the digitalization or processes and increasing number of sensors to capture events in a connected world. Streams are inherently unbounded and often unordered, which requires a fundamental shift of approach to guarantee correctness while enabling new techniques for real-time insights.

The goal of this thesis is to build the understanding required for the design of correct, fault-tolerant, low-latency and scalable event stream analytics solutions whose key challenges are time and state. Then we demonstrate the concepts and design considerations through the implementation of a real-time public transportation analytics solution, which we evaluate to further highlight the practical challenges of building such a solution. The findings and considerations can be applied to a wide range of stream analytics use cases and can help developers and architects to build a stream-native mindset.
