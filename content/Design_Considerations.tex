\section{Stream Transport Platforms}
rabbitmq
activemq
kafka

\subsection{Apache Kafka}
present Kafka
commercial distributions like confluent provide tiered retention



\section{Stream Processing Platforms}
storm
spark streaming
spark structured streaming
spark has good ML libraries
wso2
esper
comparison of frameworks: https://youtu.be/PiEQR9AXgl4

\cite{Shahverdi.2019} shows performance
add feature list

mention apache beam as higher level unified API running on top of these platforms
implementation of dataflow model



\subsection{Apache Flink}


\subsubsection{APIs}
datastream, dataset, SQL
async queries
event time
unit testing
watermarking strategies

\subsubsection{Cluster}
workers and masters
task slots
high availability

\subsubsection{Execution Model}
tasks
operators
parallelism
co-location and operator chaining
shuffling after keyby
watermark propagation
backpressure sampling

code evolution, switch live to newer version, recomputation only possible of data are retained, but same with batch

\subsubsection{State}
state backends
broadcast state

\subsubsection{Checkpointing}
barriers
aligned and unaligned


\subsubsection{Network Stack}
backpressure handling
flow control
latency vs throughput
https://flink.apache.org/2019/06/05/flink-network-stack.html

\subsubsection{Flink + Kafka}
replay
partitioning
high availability

also managed versions on AWS, but set up ourselves to understand better
